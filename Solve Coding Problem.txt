Solving a coding problem requires a step-by-step approach that involves understanding the problem, designing a solution, implementing the solution, and testing it to ensure that it works as expected. Here is a general process that you can follow to solve a coding problem:

Read and understand the problem statement: Carefully read the problem statement and make sure that you understand what the problem is asking you to do.

Identify the inputs and outputs: Determine what inputs the function will receive and what outputs it should return.

Break down the problem: Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems that are easier to solve. This will help you to avoid getting stuck on a large problem and make the problem more manageable.

Design a solution: Once you have broken down the problem, design an algorithm or a plan that will help you to solve the problem. Write down the steps you will take to solve the problem.

Implement the solution: Write the code to implement the solution that you have designed.

Test the solution: Test the code to make sure that it works correctly. Check for edge cases and make sure that the code handles all possible inputs and outputs.

Optimize the solution: Once you have a working solution, you can optimize it to make it faster, more efficient, or more elegant.

Refactor the code: Finally, review your code and make sure that it is clean, readable, and well-organized.

Following these steps should help you to solve coding problems more effectively. Remember that practice makes perfect, so the more problems you solve, the better you will become at coding.
